# User experience

When I land on the page I am greeting with a blinking terminal prompting a login
username
and email

If I submit an email then I join the mailing list otherwise the username is stored in state
for later

When I am 'logged in' I can choose to init GUI mode which will be a bookshelf

The Command line-

- if I dont not init GUI mode then i can ls show dirs
- /opera
- /engineering
- /blog
- /about
  at / there is a surprise of some kind TBD

each of those pages is its on page on the bookshelf

The BiographicalBookShelf/ Menagerie-
all the same pages all part of a bookshelf
to progress through my timeline or regress,
use vim key bindings
using } takes you to the next epoch(page)
perhaps there can be a loading screen with a wise quote and music
think witcher 3 loading

# Pages-

## engineering-

trade tiger-- Trade tiger is being rebuilt with nextjs
sfm
nvim config
dotfiles
side projects

## Opera

literally enter the menagerie and walk around an environment with a few video of a performance
and pictures from the cruise ship.

## blogging

a Blog, minimal, sleek, with a personal touch

## Resume

But a life resume
This is a list of reasons why I would be awesome on your team.

# Phases

# User experience- WIP

When I land on the page I am greeting with a blinking terminal prompting a login
username
and email

If I submit an email then I join the mailing list otherwise the username is stored in state
for later

When I am 'logged in' I can choose to init GUI mode which will be a bookshelf

The Command line-

- if I dont not init GUI mode then i can ls show dirs
- /opera
- /engineering
- /blog
- /about
  at / there is a surprise of some kind TBD

each of those pages is its on page on the bookshelf

The BiographicalBookShelf/ Menagerie-
all the same pages all part of a bookshelf
to progress through my timeline or regress,
use vim key bindings
using } takes you to the next epoch(page)
perhaps there can be a loading screen with a wise quote and music
think witcher 3 loading

# Pages-

## engineering-

trade tiger-- Trade tiger is being rebuilt with nextjs
sfm
nvim config
dotfiles
side projects

## Opera

literally enter the menagerie and walk around an environment with a few video of a performance
and pictures from the cruise ship.

## blogging

a Blog, minimal, sleek, with a personal touch

## Resume

But a life resume
This is a list of reasons why I would be awesome on your team.

# Phases

## 1
Terminal emulator  
Build the REPL
lexer and parser completed to level of MVP
command history and virtual file system

Build the Engineering Page ( emulate a markdown file) and Resume Page.

## 2
add GUI-MODE command, to dynamically change the page styling, from a terminal to a gui. HTML structure should stay the same
similiar to light mode dark mode, except with much more dynamic changes

consider adding in the ability to users to call commands to change colors in the gui.  can access terminal with :Command sytanx like in vim

## 3

learn a 3d rendering library and create the bookshelf
allow for parsing off additional commands to navigate users to different pages with keybindings.(this needs more thought)
